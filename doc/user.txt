Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Presenting Sci2Web_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sci2Web_ is a tool to provide graphical web interfaces to *Naturally
Developed Scientific Applications* (NDSAs).  NDSAs is a generic name
we use to call those programs developed or adapted by scientist and
used in scientific research.  Although today you can find powerful
scientific software providing advanced graphical and user interfaces
(e.g. Reduce, SAGE, Mathematica, Matlab) many scientific work still
depend on programs developed in low level programming languages (C,
fortran).  Even although a growing number of scientist are using
powerful and modern languajes (C++, Java, Python) their programs still
have simplified user interfaces and most of them lack of a proper
graphical interface (in most cases these interfaces are simply not
required or not important in the scientific work).  

Most of the time scientists restrict their programs just for their
personal use or share it only with close colleagues.  But from time to
time a *good piece of code* arises having the potential to become a
publickly available program.  The decision to share a program and
allows other to use it is a wise decision that in some cases have a
very positive impact on the visibility of the developer scientific
work.  However the development of software intended for *final users*,
even although they could be experts, could be a challenge even for a
skillful scientific developer.  Many skills are required ranging from
operating system programming to advanced graphical interfaces
development. 

Sci2Web_ is a solution created for those scientist who desire to share
the software they developed with a wider scientific community but to
the lowest developing cost.  Imagine to have an *active web page* (a
web page whose content changes according to the user input) able to
configure and control the execution of your programs?  This is exactly
what Sci2Web_ provides you.  If you want to see a living example go
now to the `Diffusion application <http://www.google.com>`_.

Sci2Web_ is not a content or a version management software.  It simply
provides the required tools to configure and run NDSA applications
using the web.
