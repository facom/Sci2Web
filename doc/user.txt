Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This document presents a complete guide to use Sci2Web_.  You will
learn here how to run Scientific Applications ported to Sci2Web_
server sites and how to get previously computed results obtained by
you or any other users using the same applications.  To start using
Sci2Web_ in a given server site you have to signup for an account.
Sci2Web_ have a rather simple interface for creation and management of
user accounts albeit ensuring the security and privacy of the user
data.  Once you have created your account you will be able to select
any available versions of the Scientific Applications ported to the
Sci2Web_ server site.  In the application page you will be able to
create, run and control instances of the selected application.
Results from already finished instances of the application ran by you
or any other user could be retrieved and download from the application
page, giving Sci2Web_ the additional power of a dynamic scientific
database.  Since many scientific applications are sources of tabular
data, Sci2Web_ includes a simple albeit powerful *web plotting tool*
able to produce high quality scientific plots.  These and other user
operations will be explained in detail in the following sections.

Presenting Sci2Web_

Creating and managing an account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating an account in a Sci2Web_ server site is a simple process: you
just have to Press the Sign Up link at the top right of the page and
fill the sign up form.

Once the form is submitted a notification message is sent to your
e-mail.  You have to use the activation link sent in the notification
message to activate your new account.

.. Important:: If the server site does not support e-mail
   notifications you have to contact the web master to activate your
   new account. The e-mail of the web master is found in the footer
   area.

Once the account is activated you can login and start to enjoy the
applications served in the Sci2Web_ site.

Recovering the user password
============================

If you forget your password you can retrieve it using the login form.
A new password will be sent you by e-mail.  No re activation of the
account is required. 

Changing the user password
==========================

You can change your old password using the link *Your account*.  When
you retrieve a change of password the system will logout you
automatically and you will need to reactivate your account using the
same activation link send it when the account was first created.  

.. Important:: Sci2Web_ uses a simple albeit secure method to
   manipulate the user information.  The password is never known by
   the web master and is stored encrypted in the site database.  The
   user e-mail account is the only way an user could perform
   operations on its account.

Selecting the application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the main page of a Sci2Web_ server site you will find a list of the
served applications (generally under the tab *Served Applications*).
For each application you will find a box containing basic information:
the application icon (that is also a button to open the application),
the short and complete name of the application (including a link to
the complete description of the application), author, date of creation
and brief description.

.. image:: images/application-brief.jpg

Using the deployable list you can select the version of the
application you want to explore.  Versions having the prefix ``dev``
are reserved for development purposes and altough they can be browsed
you will not be able to create new instances of them.  Only the
application author and their contributors have permissions to create
and run new instances of this version.
