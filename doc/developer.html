<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This document explains how to port a scientific application (SA) to a
<a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> server site.  The process of porting a SA starts by testing
your application at the web server where it will be installed.  You
need to be sure that your application runs properly from the command
line before trying to configure and control it from a web interface.
If the application depends on third party software (libraries,
languages, external packages, etc.) they should be installed in the
web server or simply copied among the application files.  By porting
an application to <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> minor modifications should be done on the
application source files (if available) and no web or graphical
programming is required at all.  This is the most important advantage
of using <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a>: it allows you to create a friendly interface to
your applications with a minimum effort.  Many properties of the web
interface and the mechanisms used by <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> to control the
preparation and running of the application can be configured and
customized as will be explained here.  For the developer other details
of the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> such as the directory structure of the server site or
a brief list of critical scripts are provided at the end of this
document.  If you want to install a <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> server site at your own
computer please read the <a class="reference external" href="install.html">Installation guide</a>.  On the
other hand if you have already ported an application and want to test
it read the <a class="reference external" href="user.html">Sci2Web user guide</a>.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> is a <em>web framework</em> intended to provide web interfaces to
<em>Scientific Applications</em> (SAs).  A Scientific Application is a piece
of software developed or adapted by scientist to solve scientific
problems.  Although it is common today to find powerful software
providing advanced graphical and user interfaces (e.g. Reduce, SAGE,
Mathematica, Matlab), a huge fraction of the specific software
developed and/or used by scientist still relies on programs developed
in low level programming languages (C, fortran).  Even although a
growing number of scientist are using powerful and modern programming
languajes (C++, Java, Python) their programs still have simplified
user interfaces and most of them lack of a proper graphical interface.</p>
<p>In most cases SAs simply does not require to have such advanced user
or graphical interfaces.  Most of the time scientists restrict their
programs just for their personal use or share it only with close
colleagues and students.  But from time to time a <em>good piece of code</em>
arises having the potential to become a publickly available SA.  The
decision to share a SA and allows other to use it is a wise decision
that in some cases have a very positive impact on the visibility of
scientific work.  However the development of software intended for
what we can call <em>final users</em> and although they could be experts, is
challenging even for a skillful scientific developer.  Many skills are
required ranging from operating system programming to advanced
graphical interfaces development.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> is a solution created for those scientist who desire to share
the software they developed with a wider scientific community but to
the lowest developing cost.  It provides the means to configure a
fully albeit simple web interface even to very complex scientific
applications without the burden of change the original software or
develop advanced graphical interfaces.  But <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> is much more than
that.  It provides you a platform to publish your application in the
web, automatically generate properly prepared tarballs of your
software, give access to related papers and other information
important for the visibility of your scientific work, among other
features.  To know many of the advantages offered by <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> read the
<a class="reference external" href="white-paper.pdf">white paper</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see a living example go now to the <a class="reference external" href="http://astronomia.udea.edu.co/Sci2Web/app.php?SetApp=true&amp;App=MercuPy&amp;VersionNum=0&amp;VersionId_0=2B-dev">MercuPy</a>,
the sample application served in <a class="reference external" href="http://sci2web.org">the home site of the project</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> is not a content or a version management software.  It simply
provides the required tools to configure and run SA applications in
the web.</p>

<p>If you have not enough patience to read the rest of this document and
think that you can <em>interpolate</em> many of the details regarding the
configuration of a new <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> application, follow the next steps and
get an usable web interface to your SA in a couple of minutes.</p>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>You can test this procedure using the example
application, <tt class="docutils literal">Diffusion</tt>, coming along with the documentation of
the server site.  The example application files are located at
<tt class="docutils literal">doc/examples</tt>.  To start copy the application to the
<tt class="docutils literal">apps/bench</tt> directory to work in a clean directory:</p>
<pre class="last literal-block">
% cp -rf doc/examples/Diffusion apps/bench
</pre>
</div>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Place all your application files and any other third party files in
a single directory.  For the example application the directory will
be <tt class="docutils literal">apps/bench/Diffusion</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Test your application in the command line and be sure it runs
properly solving all the potential dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Initialize your application as a <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> application:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/sci2web.pl init --appname &lt;ApplicationName&gt; --vername &lt;VersionName&gt; --emails &lt;ContributorEmails&gt; --changeslog &lt;ShortDescription&gt;
</pre>
<p>For the first version of the newly ported application we recommend
to use the name &quot;dev&quot; (development).  This version could be used by
the developer to develop new improvements and will change in a
rutinary way.  For the example application:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/sci2web.pl init --appname Diffusion --vername dev --emails test&#64;sci2web.org --changeslog &quot;Development version&quot;
</pre>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>At this point you can add the <tt class="docutils literal">SCI2WEB_PROJPATH</tt>
path to your system path in order to make simpler the call to
the <em>sci2web utility scripts</em> such as <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web.pl</tt>.  Perform
this by adding to your <tt class="docutils literal">.bashrc</tt> file or any other equivalent
session file the line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% export PATH=$PATH:SCI2WEB_PROJPATH
</pre>
<p class="last">where <tt class="docutils literal">SCI2WEB_PROJPATH</tt> is the directory where <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a>
server site has been installed (e.g. /var/www/html/Sci2Web).</p>
</div>
<p>This procedure will create the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> configuration directory
<tt class="docutils literal">sci2web</tt> at your application.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Edit the application configuration file <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/version.conf</tt>
and set the most important properties of the application as
desired.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Identify the control <em>variables</em> (variables the final user could
change using the web interface) and describe them in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sci2web/.variables.info.temp</span></tt> template file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Identify those files containing the <em>control variables</em>, create
templates for each of them and replace the control variables for
the respective <em>substitution rule</em>.  Example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

</pre>
<p>Original content:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

</pre>
<p>New content:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[[NumberParticles]]
[[MeanFreePath]]

</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">(optative) Identify the <em>results variables</em> and describe them using
substitution rules in the file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sci2web/.results.info.temp</span></tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">(optative) Modify the code to allow pausing, stopping and resuming
actions.  Also include code to check the status of the execution.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Compile information about the control and result variables and fill

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">The problem</a></h4>
<p>The scenario: you have just finished to debug a piece of sofware you
have been using in your research.  The software seems interesting
enough for other scientists working in your field and you finally
decided to share it with colleagues.  Our example application,
<tt class="docutils literal">Diffusion</tt> for example simulates the diffusion of dust particles
inside a 2-D box and determines where at the box walls the dust
particles emerge.</p>
<p>Your software is a bunch of source files written probably in different
languages, data files, scripts and third party tools (binaries,
libraries, header files, etc.) included or not among your files.  For
example <tt class="docutils literal">Diffusion</tt> is a simple application consisting of a C source
file (<tt class="docutils literal">diffusion.c</tt>), a header file (<tt class="docutils literal">diffusion.h</tt>) a plain text
configuration file (<tt class="docutils literal">parameters.ini</tt>) and a gnuplot script
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot-out.gpl</span></tt>).  Additionally a <tt class="docutils literal">Makefile</tt> is provided to
simplify the compilation of the C program.</p>
<p>The user interacts with your program in different ways.  It is
probably that your software uses specially formatted input files
(e.g. the <tt class="docutils literal">parameters.ini</tt> file) to set up the program and takes
other input data, on which probably the action occurs, from other data
files.  It is also possible that some information enters to your
programs and scripts through the command line (e.g. the program
diffusion.out should be invoked with the name of the output file,
<tt class="docutils literal">./diffusion.out salida.txt</tt>).  More strange is that your software
depends on some input given from the keyboard.  In that case and as a
general rule of thumb we recommend to avoid any interactive input
since it will make harder to run the program in batch mode
(unsupervised runs).</p>
<p>The output of the program can be also diverse ranging from data going
to the standard output and standard error, new data files and why not
a figure or a plot produced by some plotting program (e.g. gnuplot).
Again we recommend that all plots produced by your software be
redirected to an image file eliminating any dependence of an available
X connection.  Our example application puts in the standard output a
summary report of the diffusion of selected dust particles and creates
files for those particles with the coordinates of the particle at each
step in a <tt class="docutils literal">scratch</tt> directory.</p>
<p>If you are organized enough your application includes also a simple
documentation prepared in some kind of readable format (text or html
files).  <tt class="docutils literal">Diffusion</tt> for example includes a README file.</p>
<p>All these features are typical of most of the applications developed
by scientist as part of their research.  We are calling here this type
of software <em>Scientific Applications, SA</em>.  A pictorial model of the
structure and interface of a generic SA is depicted in the following
figure.</p>
<img alt="images/SA-interface-model.jpg" src="images/SA-interface-model.jpg" />
<p>The first condition you have to meet in order to configure and control
your application with <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> is that the application compiles and
run properly from the command line.  You should perform this test in
order to check if all the third party software (inlcuding compilers
and libraries) are installed.  Another reason to make this first test
is to see if the program at run time is able to load <em>share libraries</em>
an issue not always easy to solve.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preparing-the-application">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Preparing the application</a></h4>
<p>It is time to configure your application in order to use <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> as a
web interface to control it.  In the following we will call this
procedure <em>Application Porting</em>.</p>
<p>Our example application has the following components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Source files: diffusion.c, diffusion.h, Makefile.</li>
<li>Input files: parameters.ini</li>
<li>Third party software: C compiler (external), gsl library (external)
and gsl header files (included among the files of the application).</li>
<li>Extra: an empty directory called <tt class="docutils literal">scratch</tt> where temporal data
files are stored in running time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to run the application we should compile it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% make diffusion.out
</pre>
<p>and run it passing the name of the output file through the command
line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% ./diffusion.out salida.txt
</pre>
<p>The application computes the trajectory in a random walk of a given
number of <em>dust</em> particles (by default 5000) inside a two dimensional
rectangular box.  The purpose is to compute several statistical
properties of the system such as the average number of dispersions and
the final distribution of dust particles in the box walls.</p>
<p>When the program is ran, it shows in the screen (standard output) the
last position of a selected number of particles (by default 1 each
100).  Additionally, for the particles whose position is shown in the
screen the program stores all the points in its random trajectory.
The trajectory is stored in the directory <tt class="docutils literal">scratch</tt> in files called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">path-&lt;i&gt;.dat</span></tt> where <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;i&gt;</tt> is the number of the particle.</p>
<p>The next steps require some help of a set of special scripts called
the <strong>Sci2Web utility scripts</strong>.  The scripts are located in the
directory <tt class="docutils literal">SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/bin</tt> where <tt class="docutils literal">SCI2WEB_PROJPATH</tt> is the
directory where <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> was installed in your server
(e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">/var/www/Sci2Web</tt>).  You may want to include this directory
in your path to simplify the following steps:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% export PATH=$PATH:SCI2WEB_PROJPATH
</pre>
<p>In other case you will have to invoque the scripts using the complete
path.</p>
<div class="section" id="initialize-your-application-as-a-sci2web-application">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Initialize your application as a Sci2Web application</a></h5>
<p>All the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> configuration information about your application is
stored in specially formatted files that should be copied and edited
in the directory of your application.  You can initialize all those
files with a single command using the perl <em>utility script</em>
<tt class="docutils literal">sci2web.pl</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/sci2web.pl init --appname &lt;ApplicationName&gt; --vername &lt;VersionName&gt; --emails &lt;ContributorsEmails&gt; --changeslog &lt;ShortDescription&gt;
</pre>
<p>where <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;ApplicationName&gt;</tt> is the name of your application and
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;VersionName&gt;</tt> is the name of the version you are presently
configuring.  <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;ContributorsEmails&gt;</tt> is a list of the <tt class="docutils literal">;</tt>
separated e-mails of the contributors of this version of the
application.  The contributors emails will be used to identify which
users has administrative grants on the version web page.
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;ShortDescription&gt;</tt> is a short description of this version and how
it is different from previous versions.</p>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Applications in Sci2Web should have proper names that
will be used to identify them not only in the database, the
filesystem or in all the programs of the tool, but also in the web
pages of the server site. We strongly recommend to choose properly
the names of you applications.  For example avoid the use of
<em>cryptic</em> names or very short or encoded names and please <strong>DO
NOT</strong> use spaces or special symbols in the names of your
application.</p>
<p class="last">Each Application could have multiple versions.  This is a very
important feature of <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a>.  Since scientific application evolve
sometimes very fastly and it is hard to ask users to follow any
change you make in your application, versions will be the way as
the developer takes <em>snapshot</em> of its work and release static
versions of the application.  If new changes must be done on a
given version of your application is better to create a new version
instead of changing an existing one.  To reduce the burden of
create versions for any change you make on your applications
(actually not all changes will require the creation of completely
new versions being the most critical those that involve the control
variables defined in the next section) we recommend the creation of
an initial version identified as the <tt class="docutils literal">dev</tt> version.  This version
could be continuously modified.  Final users will not be able to
see that version.</p>
</div>
<p>To initialize our sample application the command will be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/sci2web.pl init --appname Diffusion --vername dev --emails test&#64;sci2web.org --changeslog &quot;Development version&quot;
</pre>
<p>As has been said before the initialization step creates all the
configuration files required to set up a Sci2Web application and
gather them into a single subdirectory named <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web</tt>.  Do not move
or change the name of this subdirectory.</p>
<p>Once your application has been initialized you have to fill out the
configuration files.  Several files are automatically filled using the
utility scripts by other ones should be eidted manually.  We will
explain below which files and how should be edited.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="identifying-the-control-variables">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Identifying the <em>control variables</em></a></h5>
<p>The first step to configure a <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> ported application, is to
select the variables that could be controlled by the user.  We will
call them the <em>control variables</em>.  The value of the control variables
will be passed by the user using a web form in the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> interface.</p>
<p>The most natural source of control variables are the input files.  In
our example application this role is played by the <tt class="docutils literal">parameters.ini</tt>
file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
10000
0.1
3 5
</pre>
<p>The first value in this file is the total number of particles that
will be used in the simulation.  The second one is the mean free path
in program units (see below).  The fourth and fifth parameters are the
width and height of the box also in the units of the program.</p>
<p>If you want that the user controls the value of all this variables
create a copy of this file with the name <tt class="docutils literal">.parameters.ini.temp</tt>
(<em>template file</em>) and substitute the values of the variables by:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[[NumberParticles::10000::int::Total number of particules]]
[[MeanFreePath::0.1::float::Mean free path]]
[[Width::3::float]] [[Heigh::5::float]]
</pre>
<p>The code between double square brackets is called a <em>substitution
rule</em> and have two functions: 1) <em>tag</em> the place in a file where a
control variable should be replaced by the value given by the user and
2) provide complete information to <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> about the control
variables itself, such as the internal name of the variable, the
<em>numeric</em> type and even the help text that will appear close to the
input element in the web form (see below).</p>
<p>The general syntax of a substitution rule is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[[VariableName::DefaultValue::TypeOfVariable::CompleteName::Tab::Group::HelpText::ReadOnly]]
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>VariableName</strong>: the name of the variable at the programming
level.  It should obeys the typical rules of variable names (e.g. no
blank or special characters)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>DefaultValue</strong>: default value of the variable and type of input in
the web interface.  There are different ways to specify the default
value of a control variable.  Each way determines which input
element will be used in the web form:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>Single value</em> (e.g. 3): the input is a simple text box.</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><em>Constrained value</em> (e.g. 0&lt;&lt;10==3): the input is a simple text</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">box.  The values between the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;&lt;</tt> symbols are the minimum and
maximum values.  If no minimum (maximum) value is provided it
will be assumed as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-1E+100</span></tt> (<tt class="docutils literal">+1E+100</tt>).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Range of values</em> (e.g. 0--10--1==5): double dash separated range
of values plus the default value assumed in that range.  In this
case the input is performed using a simple text box plus a scroll
bar.  This method is strongly recommended when certain values of a
variable should be avoided.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>List of values</em> (e.g. Yes;;No==Yes): double comma separated set
of values plus the default selected one.  Input is performed using
a selection tool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another type of input methods are used according to the variable
type (see next item):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Boolean values</em> (e.g. 1 or 0): value is indicated as 1 or 0.
Input is performed using a checkbox.</li>
<li><em>Files</em>: Input is performed using an upload button.</li>
<li><em>Text</em>: Input is performed with a textarea element.</li>
</ul>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last">The input method determined by the variable type
overrides the DefaultValue specification.  For example if you
create a variable with Default value <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Yes;;No==Yes</span></tt> of type
<tt class="docutils literal">text</tt> the input will be performed using a textarea element
instead of a select element as expected from the default value
specification.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Type of variable</strong>: most of the types follows the mysql convention
without modifiers (e.g. int instead of int(8)).  Other types are
specific to <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> (text,bool,file).  Valid datatypes are: int,
float, varchar, bool, file and text.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Complete name of the variable</strong>.  This name will be used as the
text before the input element in the web form.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Tab</strong>: the configuration window used to input the application
control variables is divided in tabs.  Tabs allows you to create
group of control variables having different effects on the
applications.  For example you can distinguish among variables with
the value of physical properties of your applications and variables
controlling numerical attributes.  The Tab field in the substitution
rule allows you to classify you control variables.  Variables
without a Tab attribute will be classified in an <tt class="docutils literal">All</tt> default
tab.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Group</strong>: in each tab variables are organized by groups.  This a
second level of organization introduced specially to be used with
very complex applications.  Variables without a Group attribute will
be classified in a <tt class="docutils literal">General</tt> default group.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>ReadOnly</strong>: this property is used to enable or disable the
possibility to change the control variable through the web form.
Left blank if you want to enable the input of the variable and use
<tt class="docutils literal">readonly</tt> to disable the input.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a control variable in more than one file you should create
a template version of those files and place therein the respective
substitution rules.  In our sample application the file
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot-out.gpl</span></tt> contains the number of particles as part of the figure
title.  In that case create a template copy <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.plot-out.gpl.temp</span></tt> and
put the substitution rule for the control vairable
<tt class="docutils literal">NumberParticles</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
name=&quot;[[OutputFile::salida::varchar::Name of the output file]]&quot;
set title &quot;Diffusion of [[NumberParticles]] particles&quot;
set term png
set output name.'.png'
plot name.'.txt' u 2:3 w p
</pre>
<p>Please notice that you do not need to use the complete substitution
rule in the second template file.  This behavior will save a lot of
work when parametrizing your application.</p>
<p>It is interesting to notice that control variables are not only
associated to <em>values</em> of real programming variables in your source
files.  Actually they can substitute complete parts of your files
regardless the content of the file or the role of the substituted
part.  In the <tt class="docutils literal">parameters.ini</tt> example the control variable
substitute a single numeric value but in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot-out.gpl</span></tt> example
substitute part of a string.</p>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>to simplify the parametrization of complex applications
we recommend to edit a <em>master template file</em>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sci2web/.variables.conf.temp</span></tt> containing the full substitution
rules for all the control variables in your application.  Using
this file will avoid you the burden of filling your application
template files with long substitution rules that will be made those
file probably prune to errors.  In our sample application this
master template file could be have the following lines:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
NumberParticles=[[NumberParticles::10000::int::Total number of particules]]
MeanFreePath=[[MeanFreePath::0.1::float::Mean free path]]
Width=[[Width::3::float]]
Height=[[Heigh::5::float]]
OutputFile=[[OutputFile::salida::varchar::Name of the output file]]
</pre>
<p>Once this file is created the application template files
<tt class="docutils literal">.parameters.ini.temp</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">.plot.gpl.temp</tt> could just contain
simplified versions of the substitution rules.  For example the
<tt class="docutils literal">.parameters.ini.temp</tt> will now look much readable:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[[NumberParticles]]
[[MeanFreePath]]
[[Width]] [[Heigh]]
</pre>
<p class="last">More importantly about the use of a master file to gather the
information about the control variables is that you can control
there the exact order on which the variables will be organized in
the web interface.</p>
</div>
<p>There are finally a set of very important variables that should be set
up to complete the <em>parametrization</em> of your application. They are
called the <em>results variables</em>.</p>
<p>These variables are set up using an already created template file
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sci2web/.results.info.temp</span></tt>.  For our example application we define
a result variable called <tt class="docutils literal">MeanDispersions</tt> that will be set after
the execution of the application with the average number of
dispersions suffered by the dust particles:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sci2web/.results.info.temp:

MeanDispersions=[[MeanDispersions::0::float::Average number of dispersions::Results::General::This is a result variable::readonly]]
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">tab</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">group</tt> for the results variables should not be
modified.</p>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>In order to use properly the results variable feature
of <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> you should configure your application to write down the
value of these variables after the execution of a running instance.
For our example application it could be done for example changing
the master source file including the following lines:</p>
<p>Original code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for(i=ini;i&lt;=N;i++){
  condition=((i%per)==0 || i==ini);

<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last">The order of tabs, groups and variables in the
<tt class="docutils literal">controlvars.info</tt> file will determine the order at which those
tabs, groups and variables are displayed in the configuration
window.  When this file is generated the order is practically
arbitrary.  It is strongly recommended to check this file and if
required change the order to fullfil your expectations about how
the web interface of your application should looks like.</p>
</div>
<p>At this point you can try to generate the files for your application
using the template files and the default <em>run configuration file</em>
(<tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/templates/Default.conf</tt>) just created.  To perform this
run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% sci2web/bin/sci2web.pl genfiles --runconf sci2web/templates/Default.conf --rundir .
</pre>
<p>This command will create the run files corresponding to each template
you have previously created.  In our sample they correspond to the
<tt class="docutils literal">parameters.ini</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot-out.gpl</span></tt> files.  Please check these
files and verify that they have the proper content.  Another file is
created <tt class="docutils literal">run.conf</tt>.  This is a copy of the run configuration file
and can be used to know what are the values of the control variables
used in a particular run.</p>
<p>You can play around modifying <tt class="docutils literal">run.conf</tt> and generating again the
run files:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% sci2web/bin/sci2web.pl genfiles --runconf run.conf --rundir .
</pre>
<p>This exercise will give you an idea if your template files and control
variable configuration files are properly prepared.</p>
<p>The ultimate test is to generate test run files using a particular set
of values properly set up in your <tt class="docutils literal">run.conf</tt> and see if your
application compiles and run as expected.</p>
<p>Be sure that you have test it your newly configured application before
to proceed with the following steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configure-your-application">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Configure your application</a></h5>
<p>Control variables are the most important component of a <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a>
ported applications.  At this point you have initialized your
application and configured how a running instance will be parametrized
and generated.</p>
<p>There are other important aspects of your application that need to be
configured before to install it at the Sci2Web server site.  Please
follow carefully the next procedure to complete your configuration:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>The running pipeline</strong>.  In real life every SA is normally ran
following a fixed set of system commands, a.k.a. the <em>running
pipeline</em>.  For example you could start by cleaning the run
directory, then you compile your source files, run your
application, perform several post-run actions and check your
results.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> control scripts run every ported application following
a fixed pipeline that should be configured using the
<tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/runpipeline.conf</tt> file.  You can provide there the
explicit commands (<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;ACTION&gt;CMD</tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;ACTION&gt;</tt> could be
<tt class="docutils literal">CLEAN</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">COMPLIE</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">SUBMIT</tt>, etc., see below) or the name of
specially prepared scripts (<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;ACTION&gt;SCR</tt>) that should be
executed at each step of the running pipeline.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> pipeline recognize the following set of actions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Clean</em>.  Clean of the run directory.  This action should be
configured if the run directory must be cleaned before to run the
application.</li>
<li><em>Compile</em>.  Compile the source files of the application.  This
action should be configured if your application requires some
kind of compilation.  It should not be configured if you are
using already compiled programs or not compiling languages
(e.g. perl, bash, python).</li>
<li><em>Preparation</em>.  Prepare the run directory to run the application.
Configure this action if your application require some previous
preparation before to run it.</li>
<li><em>Submit</em>. Run the application.  Here you should say the system
what is the particular command used to run your application.</li>
<li><em>Pause</em>.  Pause a running application.  Configure this step only
if your application could be paused.  Pausing is a special
feature of an application that allows you to temporally suspend a
running instance and resume it exactly where the computation be
when the instance was interrupted.  Not all the applications
could be paused but if you can program this feature in your
source files it could be a very useful property.  Leave blank
both <tt class="docutils literal">PAUSESCR</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">PAUSECMD</tt> variables if the application
is not <em>pausable</em>.  In this case the action <em>Pause</em> will trigger
the <em>Kill</em> action on the application.</li>
<li><em>Stop</em>. Stop a running application.  Here applies the same
recommendations given for the <em>Pause</em> step.</li>
<li><em>Post</em>.  Commands to be executed after the running instance of
the application has finished.</li>
<li><em>Status</em>.  Check the status of the run.  The command configured
here should be able to return a number between 0 and 1 with the
degree of advance of your run.  If you are not able to check this
return a -1 value as the running status.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">runpipeline.conf</tt> file for our example application will look
like:</p>

.. Important:: The run pipeline of Sci2Web_ requires that the
   application creates an empty *signal file* with the name
   ``end.sig`` when it has successfully finished.  You can include
   the command to create this file in your source codes, in a run
   script or in your makefile.  For our example application you
   could add at the end of the ``diffusion.c`` file the following
   line::

      system(&quot;dat +%s.%N &gt; end.sig&quot;);
</pre>
<p>It should be mentioned that the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;ACTION&gt;SCR</tt> value overrides the
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;ACTION&gt;CMD</tt> command.  Thus for example in the last part of the
previous example file the <tt class="docutils literal">STATUSSCR</tt> is executed beside the fact
that a <tt class="docutils literal">STATUSCMD</tt> has been also provided.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to test the running pipeline
configuration by trying to use the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> utility script
<tt class="docutils literal">sci2web.sh</tt>.  This is the script that the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> web tools
will use when trying to control your application.  Test it by
running:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% sci2web/bin/sci2web.sh clean
</pre>
<p>If it works as expected by executing the command or script
you have configured in the <tt class="docutils literal">runpipeline.conf</tt> file, try to run
other and more complex actions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>% sci2web/bin/sci2web.sh compile
% sci2web/bin/sci2web.sh pre</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most critical action is the <em>Submit</em> one.  Verify that it works
as expected:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% sci2web/bin/sci2web.sh submit
Executing action submit:
Signal: submit
Set submit
warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
job 457 at Fri Dec  9 10:56:00 2011
</pre>
<p>If it works properly not only you will notice that the expected
output files of your application will start to appear but also a
set of <tt class="docutils literal">.oxt</tt> files are generated: <tt class="docutils literal">jobid</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">pid</tt>,``time_start``, <tt class="docutils literal">time_end</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">stderr</tt> among
others.  These files contain critical information about the running
instance used by <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> to display information related to your
run.</p>
<p>If the application runs succesfully the <em>signal file</em> <tt class="docutils literal">end.sig</tt>
will be generated.  If instead you get the file <tt class="docutils literal">fail.sig</tt>
something wrong has happened with the application.  Please verify
the output files <tt class="docutils literal">stdout.oxt</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">stderr.oxt</tt> or the running
script automatically generated by <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> <tt class="docutils literal">run.sh</tt>.</p>
<p>If any problem is detected please check the <tt class="docutils literal">runpipeline.conf</tt>
configuration file and other scripts you are using to run your
application.</p>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> uses by default the batch execution system
<tt class="docutils literal">at</tt>.  It will try to execute all the running instances on the
local web server despite the fact that the processor is very
busy. This is not a recommended configuration and should be used
only if you are using <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> for personal purposes.</p>
<p>If you want to work with a different batch execution system the
<a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> server site manager should add to the
<tt class="docutils literal">SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/bin/queues.sm</tt> file the set of routines
describing how to submit, check the status and kill the job in
the respective execution system.  The <tt class="docutils literal">queues.sm</tt> file
provided with the present version of <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> contains the
routines for the at, batch and torque/pbs execution system.  You
can write down your version of this routines for different
resource managers and schedulers (e.g. LFS, GE, Condor, etc.)</p>
<p>In public servers we strongly recommend to use torque/pbs as the
batch execution system.  In the <a class="reference internal" href="#appendixes">Appendixes</a> we have included a
complete albeit simple guide to install torque/pbs at a linux
server.  You could also try to use this system even if you are
working on a private server.</p>
<p>The sample application installed with the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> server site
uses by default the <tt class="docutils literal">at</tt> system.  You can override this
behavior (and we strongly recommend to do it) by changing
manually the <tt class="docutils literal">runpipeline.conf</tt> file of every version of this
application or override the <tt class="docutils literal">at</tt> submission routines at the
<tt class="docutils literal">queue.sm</tt> file.  As an example you could tell <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> about
changing all the runs submitted with <tt class="docutils literal">at</tt> to do it instead
with <tt class="docutils literal">pbs</tt> changing the line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
at|batch)
</pre>
<p>by:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
batch)
</pre>
<p>and the line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
pbs)
</pre>
<p>by this other one:</p>
<pre class="last literal-block">
at|pbs)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The utility script <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web.sh</tt> includes another actions that
could be useful for other purposes: <strong>cleanall</strong>, cleans all the
run directory including files generated by the control script;
<strong>test</strong>, performs a complete test on the running instance
including pause, stop and resume commands; <strong>kill</strong>, kills the
presently running instance; <strong>status</strong> check the status of the
running instance.  You can run several action &quot;in tandem&quot;:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% sci2web/bin/sci2web.sh cleanall compile pre submit
</pre>
<p>This is the recommended way to test the running pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Select common files</strong>.  When <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> creates a new instance of
an application many files could be duplicated what compromises the
storage capacity of your web server.  Many of those duplicated
files could be shared among different running instances reducing
the space required to have an active <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> application.  You can
enumerate the files that will be shared using the
<tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/sharedfiles.info</tt> file.  One object should be listed per
line in this file.  For our example application if you want to
share the files <tt class="docutils literal">Makefile</tt> and all the files having the name
diffussion, and the directory <tt class="docutils literal">gsl</tt> the
<tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/sharedfiles.info</tt> will look like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Makefile
diffusion.*
gsl
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Select output files</strong>.  When an instance of an application is
finished <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> stores by default all the results produced by the
application in a results database.  It is obvious that many files
involved in your application should not be stored since they are
repeated among instances or they do not contain useful information.
You can use the <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/outfiles.info</tt> to list, with a similar
syntax as that used for the shared files, the most interesting
files to be saved as results of your running instance.  For our
example application this file could look like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
*.dat
*.png
scratch
</pre>
<p>All the <tt class="docutils literal">.oxt</tt> and the <tt class="docutils literal">.conf</tt> files, created and used by
<a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> will be stored by default.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Web interface configuration</strong>.  The web interface of your
application have the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>The information web pages</em>.  This is a set of editable web pages
containing information about your application.  These pages could
be freely edit by the creator of the application and the
crontibutors of the respective version.  These pages will be the
first thing that a visitor will see when openning the page of
your application.  It is strongly recommended to include in the
web pages information as complete as possible about your
application including links to possible documentation (that could
be also stored in the server site), download options (if
applicable) or links to the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> documentation (specially to
the user guide).</p>
<p>You can disable the information web pages by editing the
configuration file <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/version.conf</tt> and changing the
variable <tt class="docutils literal">VerTabs</tt>.  This variable controls which tabs and in
which order will be displayed in the application web page.  There
are five fixed tabs: <tt class="docutils literal">description</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">documentation</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">downloads</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">runs</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">database</tt>.  To disable for example
the documentation and download tabs, the <tt class="docutils literal">VerTabs</tt> should be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
VerTabs = description:Description;runs:Runs;database:Database
</pre>
<p>As a special feature you could preserve a given tab but give
access to its content just to authorized users (authors and
contributors).  In this case you just have to add to the tab
specification the <tt class="docutils literal">:private</tt> suffix:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
VerTabs = description:Description;runs:Runs:private;database:Database
</pre>
<p>In this case only authors and contributors will see the <tt class="docutils literal">run</tt>
tab.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>The queue system</em>.  <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> manages the execution of running
instances of the mutiple applications installed in a server site
in a similar fashion that a <em>job queue system</em>.  This feature is
particularly useful when the installed applications normally
takes a long time to be executed.  The queue system component of
<a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> is a specially designed page where a list of the running
or already ran applications are displayed.  Using this page you
will be able to create a new instance (run your application),
remove existent instances or control the execution of already
created instances.</p>
<p>If your application is too simple and does not require a complete
queue system you can switch to a simpler interface called the
<tt class="docutils literal">RunHistory</tt> mode.  Again the <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/version.conf</tt> file
should be use to modify this behavior:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
QueueMode = RunHistory
</pre>
<p>You can turn back to the queue system changing the name of the
variable to <tt class="docutils literal">QueueList</tt> (default choice):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
QueueMode = QueueList
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>The results database</em>.  All the run instances succesfully
executed with your applications and their result files will be by
default stored in a big result database.  This is a very useful
feature of <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> that could allow a community to access
already computed results that in other case will be very
expensive to recompute.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: your application is able to compute the
dynamical evolution of a two planets system changing the initial
conditions of the biggest planet.  You could vary in a huge
parameter space the initial properties of the big planet and
every configuration is a single result.  After performing a
complete parameter space exploration an user could store results
that will be useful for others desiring to explore the same or an
overlapping region of the parameter space.  With the results
database all they have to do is to search for the results already
computed for that part of the parameter space and compute only
new results in the unexplored region.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> provide any application with a specially designed page
to search for results stored in the database.</p>
<p>If your application is very simple or you do not want to store a
big amount of data coming from all the results computed with your
application disable this feature using the variable
<tt class="docutils literal">ResultsDatabase</tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/version.conf</tt> file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ResultsDatabase = false
</pre>
<p>You can turn in this feature in any moment by setting the value
of this variable to <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>The configuration form window</em>. Probably the most important
component of the whole web interface is the configuration window.
This component allows the final user to input the value of the
control variables, modify other properties of the running
instance and control the execution of your application.  There
are several attributes of the configuration window that can be
customized:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>FilesTab (boolean, default <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt>): Determines if a tab with
the list of files associated to the run are displayed or not.</li>
<li>ControlButtons (boolean, default <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt>): Determines if the
configuration window should have the buttons used to control
the application.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All these properties can be set up in the
<tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/version.conf</tt> file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>The results window</em>.  The result window is an important
component of the interface intended to display customizable
information about the results of the running instance.  A
separate configuration file <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web/resultswindow.conf</tt> for
this component is included and should be edited to change the
default behavior:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<blockquote>
<p>As you can see there is an entry for every tab you want to include
in the results window.  Every entry has three properties: <tt class="docutils literal">Tab</tt>
(name of the tab), <tt class="docutils literal">Content</tt> (content of the tab) and
<tt class="docutils literal">RefreshTimes</tt> (time to refresh the content of the tab).</p>
<p>The content of a tab could be selected among these options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>File</strong>: the content of the tab will the content of the file
indicated after ':'.  The default file path is the run
directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Module</strong>: a particular module programmed into the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a>

<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Status</em>: show the status of the run.  No parameters are

<li><em>ListFiles</em>: list of files of a given subdirectory in the run
directory.  Parameters: <tt class="docutils literal">SubDir</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Filter</tt>.</li>
<li><em>Gallery</em>: an image gallery.  Parameters: <tt class="docutils literal">Criterium</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters are given to modules using the same syntax as <tt class="docutils literal">php</tt>
scripts using an initial <tt class="docutils literal">?</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;</tt> to separate different
module parameters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">RefreshTime</tt> is given in milliseconds.  You should be
careful to not set a very small refresh time for your tabs because
it could load your web server with apache2 zombie processes.</p>
<p>At the end of this configuration file you will be able to set up
the properties of a framed version of the configuration and
results windows.  For small applications it is more comfortable to
have a single window where the configuration form and the results
are displayed together.  This is the function of this tabbed
window.  You can select here if you want that the configuration
and results frames be stacked horizontally (<tt class="docutils literal">cols</tt>, this is the
default) or vertically (<tt class="docutils literal">rows</tt>).  You can also modify the
relative sizes of the frames.</p>

<h4>Installing your application in your <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> server site</h4>
<p>The last steps in order to have your application succesfully installed
in the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> server site is to copy the application files in the
server directory and register your application in the master database.
Before to perform this last and critical step be sure that the
application directory is cleaned for all temporal files generated
during the testing phases:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% sci2web/bin/sci2web.sh cleanall
</pre>
<p>To install the application automatically use the utility script:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% SCI2WEB_PATH/bin/sci2web.pl install --appdir .
</pre>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Notice that you should call the utility script
<tt class="docutils literal">sci2web.pl</tt> using the absolute path instead of using the
symbolic link to the <tt class="docutils literal">bin</tt> directory.  This command will fail to
install your application:</p>
<pre class="last literal-block">
% sci2web/bin/sci2web.pl install --appdir .
</pre>
</div>
<p>If accidentally you have installed your application including a lot of
temporal files you will still be able to clean the application of the
extra files by going directly to the installed application,
e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">apps/Diffusion/dev</tt>, and running there the <tt class="docutils literal">cleanall</tt>
command.</p>
<p>If something has gone wrong with the installation you can always
remove the application, correct the problems and reinstall it.  Remove
the application using the command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% SCI2WEB_PATH/bin/sci2web.pl remove --appname &lt;Application&gt;
</pre>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>With this procedure you have installed the development
version, <tt class="docutils literal">dev</tt>.  This version will be only visible to the
application authors and the version contributors.  In order to
<em>release</em> your application and allow other users to use it you need
to create a public version from a copy of the just created
developmente version.  Run this command (we use here the names of
the example application):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% SCI2WEB_PATH/bin/sci2web.pl newversion --appname Diffusion --tempver dev --newver 1.0
</pre>
<p class="last">where <tt class="docutils literal">1.0</tt> is the code name of the new version.  Each time you
create a new version from an existing one it is strongly
recommended to edit the configuration file <tt class="docutils literal">version.conf</tt> and
change several properties that the automatic procedure will not
modify (e.g. ChangesLog or version brief description).</p>

<p>If you really appreciate to know what are the details of the procedure
outlined before and/or want to know more precisely why all the
previous command are used and how can they be modified, you can read
in the following subsections a detailed description of the application
porting procedure.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Testing your newly ported application</a></h4>
<p>If everything has been ran smoothly up to this point you are ready to
start using your application with a brand new web interface!</p>
<p>But, wait a minute! Your work has not ended here.  Probably it has
just started.  As every programming task you do not end until you have
ran and test your application in its final form.  So go to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> server site URL, sign up or sign in into an account and start
testing your application.  Seeing your application in action will give
you hints to modify the configuration you have just completed.  The
process will finish only when you are completely satisfied with the
result.  And even thens you will still have to wait for the bug reports
the user community using your application will start to send you.</p>
<p>From now on, start to work directly in the application directory at
your <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> server site.  Only the changes performed there will be
reflected in the running instances created from the web interface.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Directory structure</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> server site is a complete and functional website.  Its
structure is similar to similar web project but it has additional
features that allow it to work as a portal for on-line applications
and data repository.</p>
<p>His main directories and subdirectories are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>bin</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Directory containing the utility and <em>cgi</em> scripts.  Almost every
functionality in the server site is coded there.</blockquote>
<p><strong>lib</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Libraries of routines and global variables for the <em>cgi</em>
scripts.  It contains the main configuration file
<tt class="docutils literal">sci2web.conf</tt> and the <em>cascade style sheet</em> file for the
site <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web.css</tt>.</blockquote>
<p><strong>js</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>JavaScript</em> files and third party libraries.  Specially</dt>
<dd>important is the <tt class="docutils literal">sci2web.js</tt> file containing the routines
specific of the site.  Third party JavaScript libraries used
with <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> includes <em>jquery</em>, <em>ckeditor</em>, <em>ckfinder</em>,
<em>tabber</em> and <em>domwindow</em>.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>tmp</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Temporal directory.</blockquote>
<p><strong>log</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Directory with log files.  Specially important is the mail.log
file containing the messages generated by the site when it is
installed in a server without the e-mail service.</blockquote>
<p><strong>images</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Directory with images.</blockquote>
<p><strong>doc</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Documentation, installation and example files.  It contains
two important subdirectories: <tt class="docutils literal">install</tt> (installation
related files) and <tt class="docutils literal">examples</tt> (example applications).</blockquote>
<p><strong>pages</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Source files for the page contents.  The server site have one
static page <tt class="docutils literal">main.php</tt> and a dynamic one <tt class="docutils literal">app.php</tt> that is
populated with the information of a given application.  The
<tt class="docutils literal">pages</tt> directory contains the php scripts required to build
both pages.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The applications and all the data associated to them are installed in
two critical directories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>apps</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the directory where the apps are installed.  It
contains three default subdirectories: <tt class="docutils literal">template</tt> (template
files required to install a new application), <tt class="docutils literal">bench</tt> (blank
subdirectory that can be used to prepare new applications or
perform any sort of tests) and <tt class="docutils literal">licenses</tt> (full text of
licenses that could be used with the ported applications).</p>
<p>An installed application has a subdirectory named after the
short name of the application.  Inside this directory every
version of the application is located in a separated
subdirectory.  Other files related to the application such as
the global configuration file of the application <tt class="docutils literal">app.conf</tt>,
the editable html files describing the application properties
(brief description, documentation, downloads), the logotype
and other files common to all versions are also located there.</p>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>It is important to notice that an application
is installed in <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> if there is a subdirectory in the
<tt class="docutils literal">apps</tt> directory with its name, <strong>BUT ALSO</strong> if it has
been properly created at the <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> database level.  You
can check the content of any table of the database from the
command line using the command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% bin/sci2web.pl showdb --describe --table &lt;table&gt;
% bin/sci2web.pl showdb --entries --table &lt;table&gt;
</pre>
<p>where <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;table&gt;</tt> could be <tt class="docutils literal">users</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">apps</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">versions</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">runs</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;app&gt;_&lt;version&gt;</tt>.  To check
which applications and versions exists run:</p>
<pre class="last literal-block">
% bin/sci2web.pl showdb --entries --table apps
% bin/sci2web.pl showdb --entries --table versions
</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>runs</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This directory contains all the critical data resulting from
the interaction of users with the server site.  It contains
one default directory, <tt class="docutils literal">db</tt>, where the results of all the
successfully executed instances of the served applications are
stored.  This information is very important for one of the
central purposes of <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/user/Sci2WebPP">Sci2Web</a> as is to share data coming from
executing speciallized scientific software.</p>
<p>Each user registered in the server site has here a
subdirectory identified with the e-mail of the user and where
all the run instances of every application ran by the user are
stored.</p>
