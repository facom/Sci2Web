Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This document explains how to port a scientific application (SA) to a
Sci2Web_ server site.  The process of porting a SA starts by testing
your application at the web server where it will be installed.  You
need to be sure that your application runs properly from the command
line before trying to configure and control it from a web interface.
If the application depends on third party software (libraries,
languages, external packages, etc.) they should be installed in the
web server or simply copied among the application files.  By porting
an application to Sci2Web_ minor modifications should be done on the
application source files (if available) and no web or graphical
programming is required at all.  This is the most important advantage
of using Sci2Web_: it allows you to create a friendly interface to
your applications with a minimum effort.  Many properties of the web
interface and the mechanisms used by Sci2Web_ to control the
preparation and running of the application can be configured and
customized as will be explained here.  For the developer other details
of the Sci2Web_ such as the directory structure of the server site or
a brief list of critical scripts are provided at the end of this
document.  If you want to install a Sci2Web_ server site at your own
computer please read the `Installation guide <install.html>`_.  On the
other hand if you have already ported an application and want to test
it read the `Sci2Web user guide <user.html>`_.

Porting an application to Sci2Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quick start (Summary)
=====================

If you have not enough patience to read the rest of this document and
think that you can *interpolate* many of the details regarding the
configuration of a new Sci2Web_ application, follow the next steps and
get an usable web interface to your SA in a couple of minutes.

.. Important:: You can test this procedure using the example
   application, ``Diffusion``, coming along with the documentation of
   the server site.  The example application files are located at
   ``doc/examples``.  To start copy the application to the
   ``apps/bench`` directory to work in a clean directory::
   
     % cp -rf doc/examples/Diffusion apps/bench    

#. Place all your application files and any other third party files in
   a single directory.  For the example application the directory will
   be ``apps/bench/Diffusion``.

#. Test your application in the command line and be sure it runs
   properly solving all the potential dependencies.

#. Initialize your application as a Sci2Web_ application::

   % SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/sci2web-admin init --appname <ApplicationName> --vername <VersionName> --emails <ContributorEmails> --changeslog <ShortDescription>

   For the first version of the newly ported application we recommend
   to use the name "dev" (development).  This version could be used by
   the developer to develop new improvements and will change in a
   rutinary way.  For the example application::

   % SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/sci2web-admin init --appname Diffusion --vername dev --emails test@sci2web.org --changeslog "Development version"

   .. Important:: At this point you can add the ``SCI2WEB_PROJPATH``
      path to your system path in order to make simpler the call to
      the *sci2web utility scripts* such as ``sci2web-admin``.  Perform
      this by adding to your ``.bashrc`` file or any other equivalent
      session file the line::

       % export PATH=$PATH:SCI2WEB_PROJPATH

      where ``SCI2WEB_PROJPATH`` is the directory where Sci2Web_
      server site has been installed (e.g. /var/www/html/Sci2Web).

   This procedure will create the Sci2Web_ configuration directory
   ``sci2web`` at your application.

#. Edit the application configuration file ``sci2web/version.conf``
   and set the most important properties of the application as
   desired.

#. Identify the control *variables* (variables the final user could
   change using the web interface) and describe them in the
   ``sci2web/.variables.info.temp`` template file.

#. Identify those files containing the *control variables*, create
   templates for each of them and replace the control variables for
   the respective *substitution rule*.  Example::

      % cp parameters.ini .parameters.ini.temp

   Original content::

      10000
      0.1
      3 5

   New content::

       [[NumberParticles]]
       [[MeanFreePath]]
       [[Width]] [[Heigh]]
   
#. (optative) Identify the *results variables* and describe them using
   substitution rules in the file ``sci2web/.results.info.temp``.

#. (optative) Modify the code to allow pausing, stopping and resuming
   actions.  Also include code to check the status of the execution.

#. Compile information about the control and result variables and fill
   automatically other configuration files for the application::
   
       % sci2web/bin/sci2web-admin contvars --appdir .

   Before continue check the ``sci2web/controlvars.info`` file and
   check that the variable substitution rules and the tabs/group
   classification are as you expected.

   If an error occur or you want to change the parametrization remove
   the file ``sci2web/.hashvars`` and run again the previous command.

#. Check the generation of source files from template files using the
   default value of control variables::

       % sci2web/bin/sci2web-admin genfiles --runconf sci2web/templates/Default.conf --rundir .

  Check that the source files of your project has been properly
  generated and test again your application from the command line.

#. For further configuration of your application edit the following
   files following the instructions outlined in their templates (we
   assume that all the files are in the ``sci2web`` subdirectory):
   ``runpipeline.conf``, ``resultswindows.conf``,
   ``sharedfiles.info``, ``outfiles.info``

   .. Important:: A very important step you should perform before to
      test your application is to properly *signalize* the execution
      of your program. The run pipeline of Sci2Web_ requires that the
      application creates a *signal file* with the name ``end.sig``
      when it has successfully finished.  You can include the command
      to create this file in your source codes, in a run script or in
      your makefile.

#. Test the *run pipeline*::

      % bash sci2web/bin/sci2web-control clean
      % bash sci2web/bin/sci2web-control compile
      % bash sci2web/bin/sci2web-control submit

#. Install your application version in the Sci2Web_ server site::

      % SCI2WEB_PATH/bin/sci2web-admin install --appdir .

#. Create a release of the application (public version)::

      % SCI2WEB_PATH/bin/sci2web-admin newversion --appname Diffusion --tempver dev --newver 1.0

#. Check that everything is OK and make public your application::

     % rm -rf apps/Diffusion/1.0/sci2web/.newversion

#. Test it in the web!   

Detailed procedure
==================

The problem
-----------

The scenario: you have just finished to debug a piece of sofware you
have been using in your research.  The software seems interesting
enough for other scientists working in your field and you finally
decided to share it with colleagues.  Our example application,
``Diffusion`` for example simulates the diffusion of dust particles
inside a 2-D box and determines where at the box walls the dust
particles emerge.

Your software is a bunch of source files written probably in different
languages, data files, scripts and third party tools (binaries,
libraries, header files, etc.) included or not among your files.  For
example ``Diffusion`` is a simple application consisting of a C source
file (``diffusion.c``), a header file (``diffusion.h``) a plain text
configuration file (``parameters.ini``) and a gnuplot script
(``plot-out.gpl``).  Additionally a ``Makefile`` is provided to
simplify the compilation of the C program.

The user interacts with your program in different ways.  It is
probably that your software uses specially formatted input files
(e.g. the ``parameters.ini`` file) to set up the program and takes
other input data, on which probably the action occurs, from other data
files.  It is also possible that some information enters to your
programs and scripts through the command line (e.g. the program
diffusion.out should be invoked with the name of the output file,
``./diffusion.out salida.txt``).  More strange is that your software
depends on some input given from the keyboard.  In that case and as a
general rule of thumb we recommend to avoid any interactive input
since it will make harder to run the program in batch mode
(unsupervised runs).

The output of the program can be also diverse ranging from data going
to the standard output and standard error, new data files and why not
a figure or a plot produced by some plotting program (e.g. gnuplot).
Again we recommend that all plots produced by your software be
redirected to an image file eliminating any dependence of an available
X connection.  Our example application puts in the standard output a
summary report of the diffusion of selected dust particles and creates
files for those particles with the coordinates of the particle at each
step in a ``scratch`` directory.

If you are organized enough your application includes also a simple
documentation prepared in some kind of readable format (text or html
files).  ``Diffusion`` for example includes a README file.

All these features are typical of most of the applications developed
by scientist as part of their research.  We are calling here this type
of software *Scientific Applications, SA*.  A pictorial model of the
structure and interface of a generic SA is depicted in the following
figure.

.. image:: images/SA-interface-model.jpg

The first condition you have to meet in order to configure and control
your application with Sci2Web_ is that the application compiles and
run properly from the command line.  You should perform this test in
order to check if all the third party software (inlcuding compilers
and libraries) are installed.  Another reason to make this first test
is to see if the program at run time is able to load *share libraries*
an issue not always easy to solve.

Preparing the application
-------------------------

It is time to configure your application in order to use Sci2Web_ as a
web interface to control it.  In the following we will call this
procedure *Application Porting*.  

Our example application has the following components:

- Source files: diffusion.c, diffusion.h, Makefile.

- Input files: parameters.ini

- Third party software: C compiler (external), gsl library (external)
  and gsl header files (included among the files of the application).

- Extra: an empty directory called ``scratch`` where temporal data
  files are stored in running time.

In order to run the application we should compile it::

   % make diffusion.out

and run it passing the name of the output file through the command
line::
	
   % ./diffusion.out salida.txt

The application computes the trajectory in a random walk of a given
number of *dust* particles (by default 5000) inside a two dimensional
rectangular box.  The purpose is to compute several statistical
properties of the system such as the average number of dispersions and
the final distribution of dust particles in the box walls.

When the program is ran, it shows in the screen (standard output) the
last position of a selected number of particles (by default 1 each
100).  Additionally, for the particles whose position is shown in the
screen the program stores all the points in its random trajectory.
The trajectory is stored in the directory ``scratch`` in files called
``path-<i>.dat`` where ``<i>`` is the number of the particle.

The next steps require some help of a set of special scripts called
the **Sci2Web utility scripts**.  The scripts are located in the
directory ``SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/bin`` where ``SCI2WEB_PROJPATH`` is the
directory where Sci2Web_ was installed in your server
(e.g. ``/var/www/Sci2Web``).  You may want to include this directory
in your path to simplify the following steps::

  % export PATH=$PATH:SCI2WEB_PROJPATH

In other case you will have to invoque the scripts using the complete
path.

Initialize your application as a Sci2Web application
....................................................

All the Sci2Web_ configuration information about your application is
stored in specially formatted files that should be copied and edited
in the directory of your application.  You can initialize all those
files with a single command using the perl *utility script*
``sci2web-admin``::
	
  % SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/sci2web-admin init --appname <ApplicationName> --vername <VersionName> --emails <ContributorsEmails> --changeslog <ShortDescription>

where ``<ApplicationName>`` is the name of your application and
``<VersionName>`` is the name of the version you are presently
configuring.  ``<ContributorsEmails>`` is a list of the ``;``
separated e-mails of the contributors of this version of the
application.  The contributors emails will be used to identify which
users has administrative grants on the version web page.
``<ShortDescription>`` is a short description of this version and how
it is different from previous versions.

.. Important:: Applications in Sci2Web should have proper names that
   will be used to identify them not only in the database, the
   filesystem or in all the programs of the tool, but also in the web
   pages of the server site. We strongly recommend to choose properly
   the names of you applications.  For example avoid the use of
   *cryptic* names or very short or encoded names and please **DO
   NOT** use spaces or special symbols in the names of your
   application.

   Each Application could have multiple versions.  This is a very
   important feature of Sci2Web_.  Since scientific application evolve
   sometimes very fastly and it is hard to ask users to follow any
   change you make in your application, versions will be the way as
   the developer takes *snapshot* of its work and release static
   versions of the application.  If new changes must be done on a
   given version of your application is better to create a new version
   instead of changing an existing one.  To reduce the burden of
   create versions for any change you make on your applications
   (actually not all changes will require the creation of completely
   new versions being the most critical those that involve the control
   variables defined in the next section) we recommend the creation of
   an initial version identified as the ``dev`` version.  This version
   could be continuously modified.  Final users will not be able to
   see that version.

To initialize our sample application the command will be::

  % SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/sci2web-admin init --appname Diffusion --vername dev --emails test@sci2web.org --changeslog "Development version"

As has been said before the initialization step creates all the
configuration files required to set up a Sci2Web application and
gather them into a single subdirectory named ``sci2web``.  Do not move
or change the name of this subdirectory.

Once your application has been initialized you have to fill out the
configuration files.  Several files are automatically filled using the
utility scripts by other ones should be eidted manually.  We will
explain below which files and how should be edited.

Identifying the *control variables*
...................................

The first step to configure a Sci2Web_ ported application, is to
select the variables that could be controlled by the user.  We will
call them the *control variables*.  The value of the control variables
will be passed by the user using a web form in the Sci2Web_ interface.

The most natural source of control variables are the input files.  In
our example application this role is played by the ``parameters.ini``
file::

   10000
   0.1
   3 5

The first value in this file is the total number of particles that
will be used in the simulation.  The second one is the mean free path
in program units (see below).  The fourth and fifth parameters are the
width and height of the box also in the units of the program.

If you want that the user controls the value of all this variables
create a copy of this file with the name ``.parameters.ini.temp``
(*template file*) and substitute the values of the variables by::

   [[NumberParticles::10000::int::Total number of particules]]
   [[MeanFreePath::0.1::float::Mean free path]]
   [[Width::3::float]] [[Heigh::5::float]]

The code between double square brackets is called a *substitution
rule* and have two functions: 1) *tag* the place in a file where a
control variable should be replaced by the value given by the user and
2) provide complete information to Sci2Web_ about the control
variables itself, such as the internal name of the variable, the
*numeric* type and even the help text that will appear close to the
input element in the web form (see below).

The general syntax of a substitution rule is::
    
   [[VariableName::DefaultValue::TypeOfVariable::CompleteName::Tab::Group::HelpText::ReadOnly]]

Where:

* **VariableName**: the name of the variable at the programming
  level.  It should obeys the typical rules of variable names (e.g. no
  blank or special characters)

* **DefaultValue**: default value of the variable and type of input in
  the web interface.  There are different ways to specify the default
  value of a control variable.  Each way determines which input
  element will be used in the web form:
     
  - *Single value* (e.g. 3): the input is a simple text box.

  - *Constrained value* (e.g. 0<<10==3): the input is a simple text
     box.  The values between the ``<<`` symbols are the minimum and
     maximum values.  If no minimum (maximum) value is provided it
     will be assumed as ``-1E+100`` (``+1E+100``).

  - *Range of values* (e.g. 0--10--1==5): double dash separated range
    of values plus the default value assumed in that range.  In this
    case the input is performed using a simple text box plus a scroll
    bar.  This method is strongly recommended when certain values of a
    variable should be avoided.

  - *List of values* (e.g. Yes;;No==Yes): double comma separated set
    of values plus the default selected one.  Input is performed using
    a selection tool.

  Another type of input methods are used according to the variable
  type (see next item):

  - *Boolean values* (e.g. 1 or 0): value is indicated as 1 or 0.
    Input is performed using a checkbox.

  - *Files*: Input is performed using an upload button.

  - *Text*: Input is performed with a textarea element.

  .. important:: The input method determined by the variable type
     overrides the DefaultValue specification.  For example if you
     create a variable with Default value ``Yes;;No==Yes`` of type
     ``text`` the input will be performed using a textarea element
     instead of a select element as expected from the default value
     specification.

* **Type of variable**: most of the types follows the mysql convention
  without modifiers (e.g. int instead of int(8)).  Other types are
  specific to Sci2Web_ (text,bool,file).  Valid datatypes are: int,
  float, varchar, bool, file and text.

* **Complete name of the variable**.  This name will be used as the
  text before the input element in the web form.

* **Tab**: the configuration window used to input the application
  control variables is divided in tabs.  Tabs allows you to create
  group of control variables having different effects on the
  applications.  For example you can distinguish among variables with
  the value of physical properties of your applications and variables
  controlling numerical attributes.  The Tab field in the substitution
  rule allows you to classify you control variables.  Variables
  without a Tab attribute will be classified in an ``All`` default
  tab.

* **Group**: in each tab variables are organized by groups.  This a
  second level of organization introduced specially to be used with
  very complex applications.  Variables without a Group attribute will
  be classified in a ``General`` default group.

* **ReadOnly**: this property is used to enable or disable the
  possibility to change the control variable through the web form.
  Left blank if you want to enable the input of the variable and use
  ``readonly`` to disable the input.

If you have a control variable in more than one file you should create
a template version of those files and place therein the respective
substitution rules.  In our sample application the file
``plot-out.gpl`` contains the number of particles as part of the figure
title.  In that case create a template copy ``.plot-out.gpl.temp`` and
put the substitution rule for the control vairable
``NumberParticles``::

  name="[[OutputFile::salida::varchar::Name of the output file]]"
  set title "Diffusion of [[NumberParticles]] particles"
  set term png
  set output name.'.png'
  plot name.'.txt' u 2:3 w p

Please notice that you do not need to use the complete substitution
rule in the second template file.  This behavior will save a lot of
work when parametrizing your application.

It is interesting to notice that control variables are not only
associated to *values* of real programming variables in your source
files.  Actually they can substitute complete parts of your files
regardless the content of the file or the role of the substituted
part.  In the ``parameters.ini`` example the control variable
substitute a single numeric value but in the ``plot-out.gpl`` example
substitute part of a string.

.. Important:: to simplify the parametrization of complex applications
   we recommend to edit a *master template file*
   ``sci2web/.variables.conf.temp`` containing the full substitution
   rules for all the control variables in your application.  Using
   this file will avoid you the burden of filling your application
   template files with long substitution rules that will be made those
   file probably prune to errors.  In our sample application this
   master template file could be have the following lines::

    NumberParticles=[[NumberParticles::10000::int::Total number of particules]]
    MeanFreePath=[[MeanFreePath::0.1::float::Mean free path]]
    Width=[[Width::3::float]] 
    Height=[[Heigh::5::float]]
    OutputFile=[[OutputFile::salida::varchar::Name of the output file]]
   
   Once this file is created the application template files
   ``.parameters.ini.temp`` and ``.plot.gpl.temp`` could just contain
   simplified versions of the substitution rules.  For example the
   ``.parameters.ini.temp`` will now look much readable::

    [[NumberParticles]]
    [[MeanFreePath]]
    [[Width]] [[Heigh]]

   More importantly about the use of a master file to gather the
   information about the control variables is that you can control
   there the exact order on which the variables will be organized in
   the web interface. 

There are finally a set of very important variables that should be set
up to complete the *parametrization* of your application. They are
called the *results variables*.  

These variables are set up using an already created template file
``sci2web/.results.info.temp``.  For our example application we define
a result variable called ``MeanDispersions`` that will be set after
the execution of the application with the average number of
dispersions suffered by the dust particles::

   sci2web/.results.info.temp:

   MeanDispersions=[[MeanDispersions::0::float::Average number of dispersions::Results::General::This is a result variable::readonly]]

The ``tab`` and ``group`` for the results variables should not be
modified.

.. Important:: In order to use properly the results variable feature
   of Sci2Web_ you should configure your application to write down the
   value of these variables after the execution of a running instance.
   For our example application it could be done for example changing
   the master source file including the following lines:

   Original code::

    for(i=ini;i<=N;i++){
      condition=((i%per)==0 || i==ini);
      [...]
      j=0;
      do{
	d=-lambda*log(drand48())*CUSTOM_UNITS;
	theta=2*M_PI*drand48();
	x=x+d*cos(theta);
	y=y+d*sin(theta);
	if(condition) fprintf(fp,"%d %e %e\n",j,x,y);
	j++;
      }while(x*(x-l)<=0 && y*(y-h)<=0);
      fprintf(fl,"%d\t%e\t%e\n",i,x,y);
      if(condition){
	fprintf(stdout,"i = %d, (x,y) = (%.2e,%.2e)\n",i,x,y);
	sleep((int)SLEEP);
      }
    }

   New code::

    nidsp=0;
    for(i=ini;i<=N;i++){
      condition=((i%per)==0 || i==ini);
      [...]
      j=0;
      do{
	d=-lambda*log(drand48())*CUSTOM_UNITS;
	theta=2*M_PI*drand48();
	x=x+d*cos(theta);
	y=y+d*sin(theta);
	if(condition) fprintf(fp,"%d %e %e\n",j,x,y);
	j++;
      }while(x*(x-l)<=0 && y*(y-h)<=0);
      //-------------------->START NEW CODE<--------------------
      ndisp+=j;
      //-------------------->END NEW CODE<--------------------
      
      fprintf(fl,"%d\t%e\t%e\n",i,x,y);
      if(condition){
	fprintf(stdout,"i = %d, (x,y) = (%.2e,%.2e)\n",i,x,y);
	sleep((int)SLEEP);
      }
    }
    //-------------------->NEW CODE<--------------------
    ndisp=ndisp/N;
    FILE *fr;
    fr=fopen("sci2web/results.info","w");
    fprintf(fr,"MeanDispersions=%lf\n",ndisp);
    fclose(fr);
    //-------------------->END NEW CODE<--------------------

   If you cannot change your source file or simply does not want to do
   it we recommend to use external scripts able to extract the results
   from any output of the program (standard or standard error, output
   files, etc.) 
    
Once you have selected the control and results variables and have
created the templates from the files where those variables appear you
are ready to test the generation of source files for your runs from
those templates.  This a critical step in the generation of new
instances of the application.  To perform this important step run::

    % sci2web/bin/sci2web-admin contvars --appdir .

If an error occur or you want to change the parametrization remove the
file ``sci2web/.hashvars`` and run again the previous command.

Here we are using the symbolic link to the utility script binary
directory created in the sci2web subdirectory already installed after
the initialization of the application.  

.. important:: If you perform any changes in your control variables
   and want to update the templates for all the application instances
   already created in Sci2Web_ you should use the absolute path of the
   utility script::

     % SCI2WEB_PATH/sci2web/bin/sci2web-admin contvars --appdir .

This command create three files in the ``sci2web`` subdirectory:
``controlvars.info``, ``controlvars.sql`` and
``templates/Default.conf``.  The first one is the list of the control
variables classified by tabs and groups and properly formatted to be
used by the Sci2Web_ tool.  The second one is a sql file that will be
used in the installation step to create a table associated to the
particular version of the application where the values of the control
variables and other results are stored by each run created by the
community using the application. It is strongly recommended to avoid
the edition of this file.  The third and last file, ``Default.conf``
is a sample *run configuration file* containing the value of the
control variables that will be used to generate the files for a given
run.  In this case the values are the default ones defined when the
control variables were described using the substitution rules.

.. Important:: The order of tabs, groups and variables in the
   ``controlvars.info`` file will determine the order at which those
   tabs, groups and variables are displayed in the configuration
   window.  When this file is generated the order is practically
   arbitrary.  It is strongly recommended to check this file and if
   required change the order to fullfil your expectations about how
   the web interface of your application should looks like.

At this point you can try to generate the files for your application
using the template files and the default *run configuration file*
(``sci2web/templates/Default.conf``) just created.  To perform this
run::

    % sci2web/bin/sci2web-admin genfiles --runconf sci2web/templates/Default.conf --rundir .

This command will create the run files corresponding to each template
you have previously created.  In our sample they correspond to the
``parameters.ini`` and ``plot-out.gpl`` files.  Please check these
files and verify that they have the proper content.  Another file is
created ``run.conf``.  This is a copy of the run configuration file
and can be used to know what are the values of the control variables
used in a particular run.

You can play around modifying ``run.conf`` and generating again the
run files::

    % sci2web/bin/sci2web-admin genfiles --runconf run.conf --rundir .

This exercise will give you an idea if your template files and control
variable configuration files are properly prepared.

The ultimate test is to generate test run files using a particular set
of values properly set up in your ``run.conf`` and see if your
application compiles and run as expected.

Be sure that you have test it your newly configured application before
to proceed with the following steps.

Configure your application
..........................

Control variables are the most important component of a Sci2Web_
ported applications.  At this point you have initialized your
application and configured how a running instance will be parametrized
and generated.

There are other important aspects of your application that need to be
configured before to install it at the Sci2Web server site.  Please
follow carefully the next procedure to complete your configuration:

#. **The running pipeline**.  In real life every SA is normally ran
   following a fixed set of system commands, a.k.a. the *running
   pipeline*.  For example you could start by cleaning the run
   directory, then you compile your source files, run your
   application, perform several post-run actions and check your
   results.

   The Sci2Web_ control scripts run every ported application following
   a fixed pipeline that should be configured using the
   ``sci2web/runpipeline.conf`` file.  You can provide there the
   explicit commands (``<ACTION>CMD``, where ``<ACTION>`` could be
   ``CLEAN``, ``COMPLIE``, ``SUBMIT``, etc., see below) or the name of
   specially prepared scripts (``<ACTION>SCR``) that should be
   executed at each step of the running pipeline.

   The Sci2Web_ pipeline recognize the following set of actions:

   * *Clean*.  Clean of the run directory.  This action should be
     configured if the run directory must be cleaned before to run the
     application.

   * *Compile*.  Compile the source files of the application.  This
     action should be configured if your application requires some
     kind of compilation.  It should not be configured if you are
     using already compiled programs or not compiling languages
     (e.g. perl, bash, python).

   * *Preparation*.  Prepare the run directory to run the application.
     Configure this action if your application require some previous
     preparation before to run it.

   * *Submit*. Run the application.  Here you should say the system
     what is the particular command used to run your application.

   * *Pause*.  Pause a running application.  Configure this step only
     if your application could be paused.  Pausing is a special
     feature of an application that allows you to temporally suspend a
     running instance and resume it exactly where the computation be
     when the instance was interrupted.  Not all the applications
     could be paused but if you can program this feature in your
     source files it could be a very useful property.  Leave blank
     both ``PAUSESCR`` and ``PAUSECMD`` variables if the application
     is not *pausable*.  In this case the action *Pause* will trigger
     the *Kill* action on the application.

   * *Stop*. Stop a running application.  Here applies the same
     recommendations given for the *Pause* step.

   * *Post*.  Commands to be executed after the running instance of
     the application has finished.

   * *Status*.  Check the status of the run.  The command configured
     here should be able to return a number between 0 and 1 with the
     degree of advance of your run.  If you are not able to check this
     return a -1 value as the running status.

   The ``runpipeline.conf`` file for our example application will look
   like::

    #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    #CUSTOM STATUS COMMAND OR SCRIPT
    #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    STATUSSCR="stat.sh"
    STATUSCMD="echo -1"

    .. Important:: The run pipeline of Sci2Web_ requires that the
       application creates an empty *signal file* with the name
       ``end.sig`` when it has successfully finished.  You can include
       the command to create this file in your source codes, in a run
       script or in your makefile.  For our example application you
       could add at the end of the ``diffusion.c`` file the following
       line::

          system("dat +%s.%N > end.sig");

   It should be mentioned that the ``<ACTION>SCR`` value overrides the
   ``<ACTION>CMD`` command.  Thus for example in the last part of the
   previous example file the ``STATUSSCR`` is executed beside the fact
   that a ``STATUSCMD`` has been also provided.

   It is strongly recommended to test the running pipeline
   configuration by trying to use the Sci2Web_ utility script
   ``sci2web-control``.  This is the script that the Sci2Web_ web tools
   will use when trying to control your application.  Test it by
   running::

     % sci2web/bin/sci2web-control clean

   If it works as expected by executing the command or script
   you have configured in the ``runpipeline.conf`` file, try to run
   other and more complex actions:
   
     % sci2web/bin/sci2web-control compile
     % sci2web/bin/sci2web-control pre

   The most critical action is the *Submit* one.  Verify that it works
   as expected::

     % sci2web/bin/sci2web-control submit
     Executing action submit:
     Signal: submit
     Set submit
     warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
     job 457 at Fri Dec  9 10:56:00 2011
     
   If it works properly not only you will notice that the expected
   output files of your application will start to appear but also a
   set of ``.oxt`` files are generated: ``jobid``,
   ``pid``,``time_start``, ``time_end``, ``stdout``, ``stderr`` among
   others.  These files contain critical information about the running
   instance used by Sci2Web_ to display information related to your
   run.  

   If the application runs succesfully the *signal file* ``end.sig``
   will be generated.  If instead you get the file ``fail.sig``
   something wrong has happened with the application.  Please verify
   the output files ``stdout.oxt`` and ``stderr.oxt`` or the running
   script automatically generated by Sci2Web_ ``run.sh``.

   If any problem is detected please check the ``runpipeline.conf``
   configuration file and other scripts you are using to run your
   application.

   .. Important:: Sci2Web_ uses by default the batch execution system
      ``at``.  It will try to execute all the running instances on the
      local web server despite the fact that the processor is very
      busy. This is not a recommended configuration and should be used
      only if you are using Sci2Web_ for personal purposes.

      If you want to work with a different batch execution system the
      Sci2Web_ server site manager should add to the
      ``SCI2WEB_PROJPATH/bin/queues.sm`` file the set of routines
      describing how to submit, check the status and kill the job in
      the respective execution system.  The ``queues.sm`` file
      provided with the present version of Sci2Web_ contains the
      routines for the at, batch and torque/pbs execution system.  You
      can write down your version of this routines for different
      resource managers and schedulers (e.g. LFS, GE, Condor, etc.)

      In public servers we strongly recommend to use torque/pbs as the
      batch execution system.  In the `Appendixes`_ we have included a
      complete albeit simple guide to install torque/pbs at a linux
      server.  You could also try to use this system even if you are
      working on a private server.

      The sample application installed with the Sci2Web_ server site
      uses by default the ``at`` system.  You can override this
      behavior (and we strongly recommend to do it) by changing
      manually the ``runpipeline.conf`` file of every version of this
      application or override the ``at`` submission routines at the
      ``queue.sm`` file.  As an example you could tell Sci2Web_ about
      changing all the runs submitted with ``at`` to do it instead
      with ``pbs`` changing the line::

         at|batch)

      by::
   
	 batch)

      and the line::

         pbs)
	 
      by this other one::

         at|pbs)

   The utility script ``sci2web-control`` includes another actions that
   could be useful for other purposes: **cleanall**, cleans all the
   run directory including files generated by the control script;
   **test**, performs a complete test on the running instance
   including pause, stop and resume commands; **kill**, kills the
   presently running instance; **status** check the status of the
   running instance.  You can run several action "in tandem"::

     % sci2web/bin/sci2web-control cleanall compile pre submit

   This is the recommended way to test the running pipeline.

#. **Select common files**.  When Sci2Web_ creates a new instance of
   an application many files could be duplicated what compromises the
   storage capacity of your web server.  Many of those duplicated
   files could be shared among different running instances reducing
   the space required to have an active Sci2Web_ application.  You can
   enumerate the files that will be shared using the
   ``sci2web/sharedfiles.info`` file.  One object should be listed per
   line in this file.  For our example application if you want to
   share the files ``Makefile`` and all the files having the name
   diffussion, and the directory ``gsl`` the
   ``sci2web/sharedfiles.info`` will look like::

     Makefile
     diffusion.*
     gsl

#. **Select output files**.  When an instance of an application is
   finished Sci2Web_ stores by default all the results produced by the
   application in a results database.  It is obvious that many files
   involved in your application should not be stored since they are
   repeated among instances or they do not contain useful information.
   You can use the ``sci2web/outfiles.info`` to list, with a similar
   syntax as that used for the shared files, the most interesting
   files to be saved as results of your running instance.  For our
   example application this file could look like::

     *.dat
     *.png
     scratch
    
   All the ``.oxt`` and the ``.conf`` files, created and used by
   Sci2Web_ will be stored by default.

#. **Web interface configuration**.  The web interface of your
   application have the following components:

   * *The information web pages*.  This is a set of editable web pages
     containing information about your application.  These pages could
     be freely edit by the creator of the application and the
     crontibutors of the respective version.  These pages will be the
     first thing that a visitor will see when openning the page of
     your application.  It is strongly recommended to include in the
     web pages information as complete as possible about your
     application including links to possible documentation (that could
     be also stored in the server site), download options (if
     applicable) or links to the Sci2Web_ documentation (specially to
     the user guide).

     You can disable the information web pages by editing the
     configuration file ``sci2web/version.conf`` and changing the
     variable ``VerTabs``.  This variable controls which tabs and in
     which order will be displayed in the application web page.  There
     are five fixed tabs: ``description``, ``documentation``,
     ``downloads``, ``runs``, ``database``.  To disable for example
     the documentation and download tabs, the ``VerTabs`` should be::

       VerTabs = description:Description;runs:Runs;database:Database

     As a special feature you could preserve a given tab but give
     access to its content just to authorized users (authors and
     contributors).  In this case you just have to add to the tab
     specification the ``:private`` suffix::

       VerTabs = description:Description;runs:Runs:private;database:Database
     
     In this case only authors and contributors will see the ``run``
     tab.

   * *The queue system*.  Sci2Web_ manages the execution of running
     instances of the mutiple applications installed in a server site
     in a similar fashion that a *job queue system*.  This feature is
     particularly useful when the installed applications normally
     takes a long time to be executed.  The queue system component of
     Sci2Web_ is a specially designed page where a list of the running
     or already ran applications are displayed.  Using this page you
     will be able to create a new instance (run your application),
     remove existent instances or control the execution of already
     created instances.  

     If your application is too simple and does not require a complete
     queue system you can switch to a simpler interface called the
     ``RunHistory`` mode.  Again the ``sci2web/version.conf`` file
     should be use to modify this behavior::
     
       QueueMode = RunHistory

     You can turn back to the queue system changing the name of the
     variable to ``QueueList`` (default choice)::

       QueueMode = QueueList

   * *The results database*.  All the run instances succesfully
     executed with your applications and their result files will be by
     default stored in a big result database.  This is a very useful
     feature of Sci2Web_ that could allow a community to access
     already computed results that in other case will be very
     expensive to recompute.  

     Imagine this scenario: your application is able to compute the
     dynamical evolution of a two planets system changing the initial
     conditions of the biggest planet.  You could vary in a huge
     parameter space the initial properties of the big planet and
     every configuration is a single result.  After performing a
     complete parameter space exploration an user could store results
     that will be useful for others desiring to explore the same or an
     overlapping region of the parameter space.  With the results
     database all they have to do is to search for the results already
     computed for that part of the parameter space and compute only
     new results in the unexplored region.

     Sci2Web_ provide any application with a specially designed page
     to search for results stored in the database.

     If your application is very simple or you do not want to store a
     big amount of data coming from all the results computed with your
     application disable this feature using the variable
     ``ResultsDatabase`` in the ``sci2web/version.conf`` file::

       ResultsDatabase = false

     You can turn in this feature in any moment by setting the value
     of this variable to ``true``.

   * *The configuration form window*. Probably the most important
     component of the whole web interface is the configuration window.
     This component allows the final user to input the value of the
     control variables, modify other properties of the running
     instance and control the execution of your application.  There
     are several attributes of the configuration window that can be
     customized:

      - FilesTab (boolean, default ``true``): Determines if a tab with
        the list of files associated to the run are displayed or not.

      - ControlButtons (boolean, default ``true``): Determines if the
        configuration window should have the buttons used to control
        the application.

     All these properties can be set up in the
     ``sci2web/version.conf`` file.

   * *The results window*.  The result window is an important
     component of the interface intended to display customizable
     information about the results of the running instance.  A
     separate configuration file ``sci2web/resultswindow.conf`` for
     this component is included and should be edited to change the
     default behavior::

       ###################################################
       #RESULTS WINDOW CONFIGURATION FILE
       #Use this file to describe your results window
       ###################################################

       #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       #STATUS AND CONTROL TAB
       #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       Tab=Status
       Content=Module:Status
       RefreshTime=-1

       #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       #STANDARD OUTPUT AND STANDARD ERROR
       #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       Tab=Output
       Content=File:stdout.oxt;File:stderr.oxt
       RefreshTime=-1

       #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       #FILES TAB
       #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       Tab=Files
       Content=Module:ListFiles?SubDir=.&Filter=*
       RefreshTime=-1

       #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       #PROPER	TIES OF THE CONFIGURE AND RESULTS WINDOW
       #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       Stacking=cols
       Sizes=40%,60%

    As you can see there is an entry for every tab you want to include
    in the results window.  Every entry has three properties: ``Tab``
    (name of the tab), ``Content`` (content of the tab) and
    ``RefreshTimes`` (time to refresh the content of the tab).  

    The content of a tab could be selected among these options:

    - **File**: the content of the tab will the content of the file
      indicated after ':'.  The default file path is the run
      directory.
    
    - **Module**: a particular module programmed into the Sci2Web_
      tools.  Available modules are:

      + *Status*: show the status of the run.  No parameters are
        required.

      + *ListFiles*: list of files of a given subdirectory in the run
        directory.  Parameters: ``SubDir``, ``Filter``.

      + *Gallery*: an image gallery.  Parameters: ``Criterium``.

      Parameters are given to modules using the same syntax as ``php``
      scripts using an initial ``?`` and ``&`` to separate different
      module parameters.

    The ``RefreshTime`` is given in milliseconds.  You should be
    careful to not set a very small refresh time for your tabs because
    it could load your web server with apache2 zombie processes.

    At the end of this configuration file you will be able to set up
    the properties of a framed version of the configuration and
    results windows.  For small applications it is more comfortable to
    have a single window where the configuration form and the results
    are displayed together.  This is the function of this tabbed
    window.  You can select here if you want that the configuration
    and results frames be stacked horizontally (``cols``, this is the
    default) or vertically (``rows``).  You can also modify the
    relative sizes of the frames.

Installing your application in your Sci2Web_ server site
--------------------------------------------------------

The last steps in order to have your application succesfully installed
in the Sci2Web_ server site is to copy the application files in the
server directory and register your application in the master database.
Before to perform this last and critical step be sure that the
application directory is cleaned for all temporal files generated
during the testing phases::

   % sci2web/bin/sci2web-control cleanall

To install the application automatically use the utility script::

   % SCI2WEB_PATH/bin/sci2web-admin install --appdir .

.. Important:: Notice that you should call the utility script
   ``sci2web-admin`` using the absolute path instead of using the
   symbolic link to the ``bin`` directory.  This command will fail to
   install your application::

     % sci2web/bin/sci2web-admin install --appdir .

If accidentally you have installed your application including a lot of
temporal files you will still be able to clean the application of the
extra files by going directly to the installed application,
e.g. ``apps/Diffusion/dev``, and running there the ``cleanall``
command.  

If something has gone wrong with the installation you can always
remove the application, correct the problems and reinstall it.  Remove
the application using the command::

    % SCI2WEB_PATH/bin/sci2web-admin remove --appname <Application>

.. Important:: With this procedure you have installed the development
   version, ``dev``.  This version will be only visible to the
   application authors and the version contributors.  In order to
   *release* your application and allow other users to use it you need
   to create a public version from a copy of the just created
   developmente version.  Run this command (we use here the names of
   the example application)::

      % SCI2WEB_PATH/bin/sci2web-admin newversion --appname Diffusion --tempver dev --newver 1.0

   where ``1.0`` is the code name of the new version.  Each time you
   create a new version from an existing one it is strongly
   recommended to edit the configuration file ``version.conf`` and
   change several properties that the automatic procedure will not
   modify (e.g. ChangesLog or version brief description).

If you really appreciate to know what are the details of the procedure
outlined before and/or want to know more precisely why all the
previous command are used and how can they be modified, you can read
in the following subsections a detailed description of the application
porting procedure.


Testing your newly ported application
-------------------------------------

If everything has been ran smoothly up to this point you are ready to
start using your application with a brand new web interface!

But, wait a minute! Your work has not ended here.  Probably it has
just started.  As every programming task you do not end until you have
ran and test your application in its final form.  So go to the
Sci2Web_ server site URL, sign up or sign in into an account and start
testing your application.  Seeing your application in action will give
you hints to modify the configuration you have just completed.  The
process will finish only when you are completely satisfied with the
result.  And even thens you will still have to wait for the bug reports
the user community using your application will start to send you.

From now on, start to work directly in the application directory at
your Sci2Web_ server site.  Only the changes performed there will be
reflected in the running instances created from the web interface.  

Good luck!

Sci2Web server site anatomy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Directory structure
===================

Sci2Web_ server site is a complete and functional website.  Its
structure is similar to similar web project but it has additional
features that allow it to work as a portal for on-line applications
and data repository.

His main directories and subdirectories are:

  **bin**

	Directory containing the utility and *cgi* scripts.  Almost every
	functionality in the server site is coded there.

  **lib**

	Libraries of routines and global variables for the *cgi*
	scripts.  It contains the main configuration file
	``sci2web.conf`` and the *cascade style sheet* file for the
	site ``sci2web.css``.

  **js**

	*JavaScript* files and third party libraries.  Specially
         important is the ``sci2web.js`` file containing the routines
         specific of the site.  Third party JavaScript libraries used
         with Sci2Web_ includes *jquery*, *ckeditor*, *ckfinder*,
         *tabber* and *domwindow*. 

  **tmp**
  
	Temporal directory.

  **log**
  
	Directory with log files.  Specially important is the mail.log
	file containing the messages generated by the site when it is
	installed in a server without the e-mail service.

  **images**
  
	Directory with images.

  **doc**
  
	Documentation, installation and example files.  It contains
	two important subdirectories: ``install`` (installation
	related files) and ``examples`` (example applications).

  **pages**
  
	Source files for the page contents.  The server site have one
	static page ``main.php`` and a dynamic one ``app.php`` that is
	populated with the information of a given application.  The
	``pages`` directory contains the php scripts required to build
	both pages.

The applications and all the data associated to them are installed in
two critical directories:

  **apps**
  
	This is the directory where the apps are installed.  It
	contains three default subdirectories: ``template`` (template
	files required to install a new application), ``bench`` (blank
	subdirectory that can be used to prepare new applications or
	perform any sort of tests) and ``licenses`` (full text of
	licenses that could be used with the ported applications).  
	
	An installed application has a subdirectory named after the
	short name of the application.  Inside this directory every
	version of the application is located in a separated
	subdirectory.  Other files related to the application such as
	the global configuration file of the application ``app.conf``,
	the editable html files describing the application properties
	(brief description, documentation, downloads), the logotype
	and other files common to all versions are also located there.

	.. Important:: It is important to notice that an application
 	   is installed in Sci2Web_ if there is a subdirectory in the
 	   ``apps`` directory with its name, **BUT ALSO** if it has
 	   been properly created at the Sci2Web_ database level.  You
 	   can check the content of any table of the database from the
 	   command line using the command::

	     % bin/sci2web-admin showdb --describe --table <table>
	     % bin/sci2web-admin showdb --entries --table <table>

	   where ``<table>`` could be ``users``, ``apps``,
	   ``versions``, ``runs`` or ``<app>_<version>``.  To check
	   which applications and versions exists run::

	     % bin/sci2web-admin showdb --entries --table apps
	     % bin/sci2web-admin showdb --entries --table versions
	   
  **runs**
  
	This directory contains all the critical data resulting from
	the interaction of users with the server site.  It contains
	one default directory, ``db``, where the results of all the
	successfully executed instances of the served applications are
	stored.  This information is very important for one of the
	central purposes of Sci2Web_ as is to share data coming from
	executing speciallized scientific software.  
	
	Each user registered in the server site has here a
	subdirectory identified with the e-mail of the user and where
	all the run instances of every application ran by the user are
	stored.

Installing and configuring TORQUE/PBS
=====================================

One of the most popular systems to manage a set of computational
resources and schedule jobs to use them is the TORQUE/PBS system.  In
this section we will explain how to install and configure TORQUE in a
linux server and a set of execution nodes connected to them through
the network.  

You can find detailed description of TORQUE and further details about
the configuration of this system in the Administrator Manual at the
official site of the project
`<http://www.clusterresources.com/torquedocs>`_.

* Get the sources:
  `<http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/resources/downloads/torque>`_.

* Unpack and install the package in the server::
  
  # tar zxvf torque-<version>.tar.gz -C /usr/local/src
  # cd /usr/local/src/torque-<version>
  # ./configure && make && make install
  # make packages

* Create daemons initialization scripts: for each <service> in
  ``pbs_server``, ``pbs_sched``, ``pbs_mom`` do::

    # cp contrib/init.d/debian.<service> /etc/init.d/<service>
    # update-rc.d <service> defaults
  
* Configure:

  + Create pbs database and basic queue::

    # ./torque.setup root

  + Configure nodes::

    # nano /var/spool/torque/server_priv/nodes

    <node1> np=<np>
    <node2> np=<np>

  + Configure mom::

    # nano /var/spool/torque/mom_priv/config

    $pbsserver <head_node>

    .. NOTE:: You have to be sure that the server and the nodes IPs,
       names and aliases are properly configured in the /etc/hosts
       file.  Example::

	      192.168.0.1  headnode.net headnode
	      192.168.0.2  node1.net node1
	      192.168.0.3  node1.net node1

* Start services: for each <service> in ``pbs_server``, ``pbs_sched``,
  ``pbs_mom`` do::

  # service <service> start

* In the compute nodes:

  + Get Torque/PBS sources.
  
  + Configure, compile and install::

    # ./configure --disable-server
    # make && make install

  + Copy /var/spool/mom_priv/config from the head node to each compute
    node.

  + Configure and start the ``pbs_mom`` daemon.

* Test:

  + Check nodes::
  
    # pbsnodes -a 
    
  + Check run::

    # su -l <user>

    Create a file ``test-pbs.sh``::

    	   #!/bin/bash
	   #PBS -j oe
    	   #PBS -o /tmp/test-job.out
    	   #PBS -N Test
    	   env | grep PBS
    	   cd /tmp
    	   date
    	   ls -R / &> /tmp/test-ls.out
    	   date

    Submit and check the job::

      $ qsub test-pbs.sh
      $ qstat -a
      $ qstat -q
      $ qdel <jobid>

    Where jobid is the id of the job you have just submitted.

Enjoy!
