Diffusion 
=========

This is a simple application that uses a Monte Carlo approach to
compute the diffusion properties of dust particles in a 2-D
rectangular box.

Use this steps to run the application:

1) Compile: 
   
   make 

2) Execute:

   ./diffusion.out salida.txt

3) Plot:

   gnuplot plot-out.gpl

And voila!

An image file "salida.png" will be produced with the position of the
last scattering point of particles inside the box.  In the scratch
directory the trajectory of a given number of particles has been
stored also.

You can clean all the files using:

    make cleanall
