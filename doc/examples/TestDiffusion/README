This README describe the files used by Sci2Web to configure a ported
application.  Please read carefully this guide in order to configure
your application.  A detailed example of how to port an application
including how to edit the configuration files found in this directory
could be read in the developer guide.

This directory contains the following objects:

- bin: a symbolic link to the binary directory of Sci2Web_.  Two
  particularly important scripts could be found there: sci2web.pl, the
  configuration utility script and sci2web.sh, the control utility
  script.

- templates: a directory that will contain the configuration templates
  created by the community using this version of your application.

- changeslog.html: a web page describing the particular details of
  this version of your application.  This file can be edited on-line.

- version.conf: the master configuration file of your version.  In
  this file you can describe several attributes and customize many
  working properties of this version of your application.

- actions.conf: a critical configuration file that contains the list
  of commands or scripts used at each step of the application life
  cycle.  Here you can configure how the application is compiled,
  cleane, ran, etc.

- resultswindow.conf: a configuration file describing the content of the
  results window of the Sci2Web interface to your application.  Here
  you will be able to customize which information will be displayed in
  the result window when a run has been completed.  For more
  information about how to properly edit this file see the developers
  guide.

- links.info, outfiles.info: this two info files list the files of a
  gicen run of your application that are common to all runs and should
  be simply linked in the run directory (links.info).  This avoid an
  unnecessary use of storage space in your web server.  outfiles.info
  list the files and directories produced as new information by your
  run.  The objects listed in this file will be preserved in the
  database of results associated to your application so it is strongly
  recommended to select them properly.

- controlvars.info: an "info" file containing the descriprion of the
  control variables of this particular version of your application
  (for an explanation about what the control variables are see the
  developers guide).  This file is created automatically by the
  configuration utility script and it is not recommended to edit it
  manually.

- controlvars.sql: a sql file containing the commands required to
  create a table in the Sci2Web database intended to store the
  properties of all the runs of your application created by the
  community.  This file is created automatically by the configuration
  utility script and it is not recommended to edit it manually.

- .resultsvars.info.temp: an "info" template file containing the list
  of variables used to report a summary of the results obtained by the
  application run.  The variables in this file should be formatted
  with the syntax of the substitution rules explained in the devloper
  guide.
