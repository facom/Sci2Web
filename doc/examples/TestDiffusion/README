Diffusion 
=========

This is a simple application that uses a Monte Carlo approach to
compute the diffusion properties of dust particles in a 2-D
rectangular box.

Use this steps to run the application:

1) Compile: 
   
   make 

2) Execute:

   ./diffusion.out salida.txt

3) Plot:

   gnuplot plot-out.gpl

And voila!

An image file "salida.png" will be produced with the position of the
last scattering point of particles inside the box.  In the scratch
directory the trajectory of a given number of particles has been
stored also.

You can clean all the files using:

    make cleanall

This application can be paused, stopped and resumed using specially
designed ".sig" files.  If you want to pause the application create a
blank file called pause.sig:

    touch pause.sig

It also applies for the stopping case:

    touch stop.sig

To resume the running (only in the case it was paused) remove the
pause.sig files and run again:
	   
    rm -rf pause.sig
    ./diffusion.out salida.txt

it will start where it went when the pause signal was delivered.

You can also check the advance of the program using the bash script
"stat.sh".  It gives you the degree of completion of the computation
in a 0 to 1 scale.
