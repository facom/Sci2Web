<p>
	Welcome to the <strong>application platform&nbsp;</strong>ofs $SCI2WEB at the <b><a href="$PHP[SERVER]">$PROJ[SCI2WEBSITE]</a></b>.</p>
<p>
	$SCI2WEB is intended to allow scientist put their <b>naturally developed scientific applications (NDSA)</b> available to other colleagues, students and collaborators in order to increase the impact and visibility of their works.</p>
<p>
	<b>Naturally developed scientific application (NDSA)</b> are small to medium size software developed as a part of a scientific project to solve specific problems. Many of them becomes rapidly fundamental in the research work of entire teams and even in complete fields. However and although the development of new and easy to use high level languages are changing the situation, many NDSA have simple natural interfaces and no graphic interaction with users. People that use them have to learn hardly how the software work, how they can use it and how the information retrieved by them can be processed.</p>
<p>
	$SCI2WEB is a general purpose web platform designed to provide simple but powerful web interfaces to NDSAs that improves the usability of the software, increase the visibility of what normally are hidden products of scientific research and if required allow easily other researchers to use the software.</p>
