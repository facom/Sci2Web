	<span style="font-size:20px;">Welcome to the $SCI2WEB <strong>server site</strong> at the&nbsp;<a href="$PHP[SERVER]">$PROJ[SCI2WEBSITE]</a>. &nbsp;This is a mirror site of the <a href="http://sci2web.org">Sci2Web home site</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">
	<span style="font-size:20px;">In this site you will find <strong>publicly served</strong> several <strong>scientific applications</strong> developed and adapted by researchers in our institution and research group.</span></p>

	<span style="font-size:20px;">$SCI2WEB is a <strong>web suite </strong>intended to provide <strong>simple but powerful web interfaces</strong> to what are called&nbsp;<b>Naturally Developed Scientific Applications (NDSAs)</b>. &nbsp;NDSAs are software products <strong>developed or adapted</strong> by scientists as part of their own research and that can be useful to many other scientist inside or even outside their field. &nbsp;Since NDSAs are primarily developed to solve specific scientific problems, they normally lack a <strong>proper user interface</strong> and quite often low level programming skills could be required to get, compile and use them. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">
	<span style="font-size:20px;">$SCI2WEB allows scientists to make publicly available their software even to users without the skills or the computer power to run their codes. &nbsp;You will find&nbsp;In this server site several scientific applications ported to a $SCI2WEB environment and ready to be ran in our servers.</span></p>
