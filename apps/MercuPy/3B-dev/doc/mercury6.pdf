T*( MERCURY is written in Fortran 77. The code is slightly non standard)Tj
T*( \(e.g. it contains `end do' statements\) but it should work using most)Tj
T*( compilers.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*( MERCURY currently includes the following N-body algorithms:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(   o A second-order mixed-variable symplectic \(MVS\) algorithm)Tj
T*(     incorporating simple symplectic correctors \(see J.Wisdom et al.)Tj
T*(     1996, Fields Instit. Commun. vol 10 pp217\) - this is very fast )Tj
T*(     but it cannot compute close encounters between objects.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(   o A general Bulirsch-Stoer - slow but accurate in most situations.)Tj
T*(     You can use this when all else fails, or to test whether the other)Tj
T*(     algorithms are appropriate for the problem you want to study.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(   o Conservative Bulirsch-Stoer - twice as fast as the general BS)Tj
T*(     routine, but it will only work for conservative systems, in which)Tj
T*(     accelerations are a function of position only \(e.g. Newtonian)Tj
T*(     gravity, but not General Relativity\).)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(   o Everhart's RA15 \(RADAU\) - about 2-3 times faster than the general)Tj
T*(     version of Bulirsch-Stoer. Usually reliable, except for very close)Tj
T*(     encounters or very eccentric \(e.g. Sun grazing\) orbits.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(   o Hybrid symplectic/Bulirsch-Stoer integrator - very fast but only)Tj
T*(     moderately accurate. This algorithm can compute close encounters.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*( N.B. The symplectic integrators may give spurious results if some)Tj
T*( ===  objects have highly eccentric orbits during an integration.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*( MERCURY includes the effects of Newtonian gravitational forces between)Tj
T*( bodies that are assumed to be point masses. It can also calculate)Tj
T*( non-gravitational forces for comets \(using equations by B.Marsden et al.)Tj
T*( 1973. Astron. J. vol 78, pp211\). You can include the effects of other)Tj
T*( forces, using some algorithms, by modifying the subroutine mfo_user.for.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*( The MERCURY package consists of several drivers and subroutines,)Tj
T*( together with a number of input files that you may want to alter to)Tj
T*( suit your application.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*( The Drivers)Tj
T*( -----------)Tj
T*()Tj
T*( 1\) mercury6_1.for)Tj
T*()Tj
T*( This is the basic integration programme. It contains all the)Tj
T*( subroutines you need to carry out integrations using any of the )Tj
T*( algorithms described above. mercury6_1.for produces some output files)Tj
T*( that are in a machine-independent compressed format, and you will)Tj
T*( need the following programmes to convert this output into a format)Tj
T*( you can read.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*( 2\) element6.for)Tj
T*()Tj
T*( This programme converts an output file created by mercury6_1.for into)Tj
T*( a set of files containing Keplerian orbital elements for each of the)Tj
T*( objects in the integration. These files allow you to see how object's)Tj
T*( orbits change with time, and can be used as the basis for making)Tj
T*( graphs or movies using a graphics package.)Tj
