Advanced Python Wrap to the Mercury Package

Presentation
============

MercuPy is a wrap to the Mercury package (Chambers, 1999) intended to
provide an improved interface to this advanced N-body integrator.

To see details about Mercury see the package documentation
(doc/mercury6.pdf).

Some of the funcionalities added to Mercury using this wrap are:

- Higher level format for the initial state of the bodies in the
  system (the original Mercury package use simple ascii files big.in
  and small.in)

- Building and execution python scripts that simplifies the
  preparation of the input files and post processing tasks
  (e.g. generation of table of orbital elements and its conversion to
  tables of state vector)

- Scalability of the Mercury package, i.e. possibility to run
  muiltiple instances of the package for example to perform parametric
  studies in multiprocessors machines or in clusters.

- Physics routines to compute the properties of the simulated bodies.

- Postprocessing routines including conversion between state and
  elements vectors, change of reference frame (rotating frame of
  reference), resampling of the output, automatic plot.

- Automatic generation of information about simulations readable
  through the web.

You will find details about the installation and running of MercuPy in
the doc/MANUAL.txt file.
